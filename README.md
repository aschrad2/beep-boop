# _Beep Boop / Fizz Buzz jQuery Web Application_

#### _This is the Beep Boop independent project. The purpose of this project is to practice using looping, jQuery and DOM manipulation. 02/12/2020_

#### By _**Austin Schrader**_

## Description

Used jQuery and DOM manipulation to count through the number that was entered. However, just like Fizz Buzz, Beep Boop should replace certain values with numbers. Ie, when a number contains 1 it should instead be replaced with "Beep". When a number contains 2 it should be replaced with Boop. When a number contains 3 it should be replaced with "I'm sorry Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that. 13 and 32 should be replaced with "I'm sorry Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that. Lastly, 21 with should be replaced with "Boop". The rules are in order of importance, and thus the top most rule should trigger the replacement as opposed to a lower level rule.
